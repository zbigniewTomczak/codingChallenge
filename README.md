# Coding challenge training exercises

The goal of Coding Challenge training is to teach people to tackle small and bigger problems with *test first* approach.
With this approach you can split up the problem into smaller chunks. Each chunk needs to be so small that you don't have to think extensively about implementing it. This gives you enough confidence to move forward. Having test specification further improves your confidence.

During the training participants are encouraged to practice "wishful thinking". Coders are stating their intentions first in form of tests and mocks and fill up the implementation later. 


Coding challenge is conducted in small groups. Each person has "performs" in front of the group with live implementation.
We have one important rule:
* Don't criticize. Everyone has it's own view of possible solution. It's interesting to see how others think and code.

Day to day work of developers belongs to two main categories: problem solving and performance. Problem solving is directly related to ability to learn. Problem solving is one the most important skill for a coder to have. Performance is that crucial but it helps a lot in work. It takes off the necessity of thinking things not directly relevant to the problem being solved. Think of a pianist who performs a Mozart sonata. Does he needs to think which pedal to press on a piano to sustain the notes? Does a programmer needs to think:
- What shortcut is for rename method?
- Should I write all methods when implementing interface or allow my IDE to generate it?
- What is naming convention of unit tests?
This type of questions are directly related with performance. Do you know and use your tools (IDE) optimally? This type of performance is practice in kata. You can find great katas like classic Bowling game kata or String calculator kata.

Katas are prerequisite for Coding challenge. During coding challenge you will practice so you save your mental energy and don't need to ask yourself: 
- Should I create new class?
- Should I create new method?
- How long this method can be? 
- Is it necessary to extract method?
- How do I structure algorithm?
- What should I test?
- What I don't need to test?
- How should I structure my tests?

During coding challenge you will be asked not to think too much about the solution and have faith in following the approach. 
Most of the problems you face during Coding challenge is small enough that if you will usually jump right to the implementation. I would like you to fight this temptation. Coding challenge approach works for bigger problems too but because of time limitation we are forced to work on small examples.
